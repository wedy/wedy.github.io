Say bye to Radiant, Hi to Jekyll

no more maintaining radiant gems and all dependencies, no more databases and pesky updates on dreamhoster :)

took me 15 mins to install and set [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) up and running, also thanks to [Github.Io for supporting Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)
