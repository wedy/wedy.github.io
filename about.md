Welcome to my site v4, started from PHP4 -> Wordpress -> Ruby Radiant now the Jekyll

I`m currently working at Bigcommerce Sydney, as a FullStack Software Engineer doing Ruby and other thing like PHP, Golang

I like science fiction, backend coding, coffee, solving problems, video games, GOOD video games, jokes, gifs, memes, fishing, soccer

If you want to say Hi, or discussing any good science fiction movies / TV series, wondering who is the best Doctor? or why Firefly got axed by Fox? or argue with me, why Jruby why not MRI? which one is better Messi or Ronaldo? You can send me an email

If you like what I do or wondering what I do for living, please check my resume on LinkedIn, and check my Github repos
